    <h1>Methods</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm/8in
        sandwich tins.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the cake, place all of the cake ingredients, except the boiling
        water, into a large mixing bowl.<br />
        Using a wooden spoon, or electric whisk, beat the mixture until smooth
        and well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the boiling water to the mixture, a little at a time, until smooth.
        (The cake mixture will now be very liquid.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the cake batter between the sandwich tins and bake in the oven
        for 25–35 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch <br />and a
        skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the chocolate icing, heat the chocolate and cream in a saucepan over
        a low heat until the chocolate melts.<br />
        Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture until smooth, glossy
        and thickened.<br />
        Set aside to cool for 1–2 hours, or until thick enough to spread over
        the cake.<br />
        To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside of the
        cake tins to loosen the cakes. <br />Carefully remove the cakes from the
        tins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a little chocolate icing over the top of one of the chocolate
        cakes, then carefully top with the other cake.<br />
        Transfer the cake to a serving plate and ice the cake all over with the
        chocolate icing, using a palette knife.<br />
        Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely, still in
        their tins, before icing.
