        Gather and measure out all of the ingredients. Good bakers know that
        moving quickly and efficiently in <br />the kitchen leads to better
        cakes and smaller messes. Measuring out ahead of time makes it possible.

        Cream shortening and gradually add in sugar. Use an electric mixer set
        to medium speed.<br />
        Add the sugar along the edges and slowly work it in to avoid sugar
        splatter.

          >Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each egg is added. Mix in
          well, keeping your beater moving. It is okay<br />
          if you add them both at once, too.</i>
